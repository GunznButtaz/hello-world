# hello-world
My first git-hub repository that I am using to get started and to learn in order to set up a new development environment using Ruby on Rails running on Windows 10 somehow or way instead of installing a VM running Ubuntu.
I am making a change to this file to begin to understand how to use Github to cooperate and edit a project with other people I may be working with.
